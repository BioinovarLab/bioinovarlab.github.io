## Access

You need an account on IoT-LAB testbed and the API authentication is based on HTTP Basic Authentication with your credentials (login/password)

The main endpoint of the REST API is [https://www.iot-lab.info/api](https://www.iot-lab.info/api)

## Methods

We provide a documentation generated from the Swagger API design tool. It's ordered by main endpoints like experiments, nodes, sites or users. You can visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources directly from the documentation. This official documentation may be consulted here [https://api.iot-lab.info](https://api.iot-lab.info)
