## Quickstart

The testbed is distributed among several sites. The main server serves the open API that allows all interactions. Thus, the testbed could be accessed through the Web portal or using provided command-line tools.

In addition, the testbed offers a hosted environment on SSH front-ends (one per IoT-LAB site), featuring pre-installed command-line tools, target architectures cross-compiler toolchains, experiments results, and access to devices serial ports. It is also possible to use a dedicated Ubuntu virtual machine, based on VirtualBox, on your Linux/Mac/Windows workstation, with the same features installed.
