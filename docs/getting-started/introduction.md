## Quickstart

The testbed is distributed among several sites. The main server serves the open API that allows all interactions. Thus, the testbed could be accessed through the Web portal or using provided command-line tools.

In addition, the testbed offers a hosted environment on SSH front-ends (one per IoT-LAB site), featuring pre-installed command-line tools, target architectures cross-compiler toolchains, experiments results, and access to devices serial ports. It is also possible to use a dedicated Ubuntu virtual machine, based on VirtualBox, on your Linux/Mac/Windows workstation, with the same features installed.

### Run an experiment

<div class="row my-3">
    <div class="col-lg-5">
        <div class="mb-2 p-3 bg-info text-light text-center rounded">
            <h6 class="card-title m-0">1. Build your application</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2 p-3 bg-info text-light text-center rounded">
            <h6 class="card-title m-0">2. Select Resources</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2 p-3 bg-info text-light text-center rounded">
            <h6 class="card-title m-0">3. Configure nodes</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2 p-3 bg-info text-light text-center rounded">
            <h6 class="card-title m-0">4. Submit</h6>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Upload your firmware(s). Select the nodes that you want to use, regarding their characteristics and/or their physical topology. Associate them with a firmware, and  optionally configure some monitoring or sniffing. Submit your experimentation. The scheduler will run it at the right time.
