## Description

FreeRTOS is designed to be small and simple. The kernel itself consists of only
three or four C files. It provides methods for multiple threads or tasks,
mutexes, semaphores and software timers. Key features are very small memory
footprint, low overhead, and very fast execution. IoT-LAB uses FreeRTOS by
default for basic development for WSN430 and M3 nodes.
