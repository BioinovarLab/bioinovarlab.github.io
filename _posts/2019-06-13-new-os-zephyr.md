We are happy to announce that FIT IoT-LAB now also provides support for the [Zephyr operating system](https://www.zephyrproject.org/).

The version supported on the tested is the LTS 1.14.0 release from April 2019. The Zephyr SDK is also deployed on every SSH frontend to allow easy builds of Zephyr firmwares for supported boards.

The [Zephyr page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/os/zephyr.md %}) provides information about boards supported boards and about Zephyr support on the testbed.
