        After the first FIT IoT-LAB workshop last year in Grenoble, which hosted 70 attendees, we propose a second edition in Lille on October 14 & 15, 2015.

        This workshop has the dual purpose of allowing exchanges on research and presenting talks and tutorials on various topics in the IoT domain. It specifically targets experimentation through testing, verification, deployment, integration, management and federation of experimental platforms. It will bring together people from academia and industry, in several areas of research so that they can exchange ideas about the current and the future of the IoT.<br /> The first day will be dedicated to conference sessions; the second day to tutorials on using FIT IoT-LAB.
