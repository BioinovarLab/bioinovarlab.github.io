We are very happy to announce the release of a new location for experimentation boards on the Lille site of IoT-LAB.
{: .lead}

We’ve added Le Cube, a space for heterogeneous interoperability & compatibility

For now, we’ve deployed boards that are capable of 802.15.4 in both 2.4 GHz and sub-GHz, boards using BLE, and boards using LoRa. They all coexist in a small vicinity:

* 5 Iot-LAB M3 boards
* 5 Zolertia Firefly boards
* 5 ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 boards
* 5 BBC micro:bit boards
* 5 Microchip SAMR21 boards

The panel of offered MCUs and radio chipsets is intended to grow (total available is 64), and can include your own boards, just follow our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/boards/add-new-board.md %}) to start, and we’ll be glad to physically plug them in LeCube.

We hope you will enjoy working with this new space.
