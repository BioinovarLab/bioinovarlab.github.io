  <p>
    We are very happy to announce the release of a new location for open nodes on the Lille site of IoT-LAB.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We&#8217;ve added Le Cube, a space for heterogeneous interoperability & compatibility
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For now, we&#8217;ve deployed nodes that are capable of 802.15.4 in both 2.4 GHz and sub-GHz, nodes using BLE, and nodes using LoRa. They all coexist in a small vicinity:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      5 m3 nodes
    </li>
    <li>
      5 firefly nodes
    </li>
    <li>
      5 st-lrwan1 nodes
    </li>
    <li>
      5 microbit nodes
    </li>
    <li>
      5 samr21 nodes
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The panel of offered MCUs and radio chipsets is intended to grow (total available 64 gateways), and can include your own boards, just follow our <a href="https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab-gateway/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md">documentation</a> on the iot-lab-gateway repository to start, and we&#8217;ll be glad to physically plug them in LeCube.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We hope you will enjoy working with this new space.
