We are very happy to announce the release of a new batch of 46 boards on the Saclay site of IoT-LAB.

With these new boards, the possibilities already provided by IoT-LAB are even more extended:
- The boards are from different vendors: NXP, Microchip, ST, Nordic, Phytec, etc
- The boards provide different radios: 802.15.4, BLE, WiFi, Sub-GHz

The boards with 802.15.4 radio are deployed in the same room in order to allow developers testing wireless connectivity between heterogeneous platforms. Nodes with BLE radios are deployed in another room and are quite close to each other.  
For more details on the deployment, please have a look at the [Saclay site deployment page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/deployment/saclay.md %}).

We recall that adding support for new boards can be done by anyone: just follow our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/boards/add-new-board.md %}).

We hope you will enjoy working with these new boards.
