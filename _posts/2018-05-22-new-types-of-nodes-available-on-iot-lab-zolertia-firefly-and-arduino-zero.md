    After the addition of SAMR21 and LoRa nodes we want to formally announce the<br /> availability of new types of boards on some IoT-LAB sites, which will permit<br /> a wider range of possibilities on the testbed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; <strong>9 Zolertia Firefly boards</strong>, featuring two radios (2.4 GHz 802.15.4 Zigbee and<br /> sub-GHz), have been deployed on the Lille site. They are deployed throughout<br /> the building and, depending on the firmware you flash, will enable heterogeneous<br /> networking with co-located regular M3 nodes. A new tutorial demonstrating the short and<br /> long range capabilities is available on the IoT-LAB website [1]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; <strong>3 Arduino Zero boards</strong> with XBee shields have been deployed on the Saclay site.<br /> They are close to the existing M3 and SAMR21 nodes and thus allow to test<br /> 802.15.4 (2.4GHz) interoperability between different types of radio. A new<br /> tutorial showing the use of networking capabilities of RIOT on these boards is<br /> also available on the IoT-LAB website [2]
  </p>

    If you have some hardware that you would like to see deployed on Iot-LAB, check<br /> out this documentation [3] to implement the initial support and we will help<br /> you to finalize the on site deployment.
