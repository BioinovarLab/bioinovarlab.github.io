We are glad to announce the release of our new [Web portal](https://www.iot-lab.info/testbed/).
{: .lead}

The new Web portal covers everything from the previous site, with some new features.

**Whatâ€™s new:**

* Faster dashboard with live experiments state
* Intuitive ergonomic UI for experiment submission
* Testbed status page with running experiments and nodes properties
* Account management with user profile

Additional features will be added in the upcoming months as we complete them.

The portal is built with the Vue.js framework and leverages a new version of IoT-LAB public [REST API](https://api.iot-lab.info/).
