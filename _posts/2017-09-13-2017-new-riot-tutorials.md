In order to show networking capabilities of RIOT on the testbed, the IoT-LAB team has prepared 3 new tutorials:

* [Public IPv6 (6LoWPAN/RPL) network with M3 nodes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link learn/tutorials/riot/riot-public-ipv6-m3.md %})  
* [CoAP server with public IPv6 network on M3 nodes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link learn/tutorials/riot/riot-coap-m3.md %})  
* [MQTT-SN with public IPv6 network and A8-M3 nodes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link learn/tutorials/riot/riot-mqtt-sn-a8-m3.md %})
