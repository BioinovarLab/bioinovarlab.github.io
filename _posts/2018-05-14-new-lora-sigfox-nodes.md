We are very proud to announce you the availability of 25 new LoRa/Sigfox boards in FIT IoT-LAB. The boards are [ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 boards](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html) with [ST MEMS extension X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2](http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html) and are **only available in Saclay site** for the moment.

One important thing is the restricted access to these boards: due to the regulated access to the ISM wireless bands in Europe (LoRa EU868 band), we will grant the access to them only for specifically approved users.

Please send a request by email to **admin@iot-lab.info** explaining your motivation and detailing your use case if you want to use them.

[A new tutorial](https://iot-lab.github.io/wordpress-static/tutorials/riot-ttn) is written to guide you through your first steps using LoRaWAN with RIOT and TheThingsNetwork.
