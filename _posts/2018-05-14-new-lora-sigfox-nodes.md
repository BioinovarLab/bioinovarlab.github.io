  <p>
    We are very proud to announce you the availability of 25 new LoRa/Sigfox nodes in FIT IoT-LAB. The nodes are <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html">ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 boards</a> with <a href="http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html">ST MEMS extension X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2</a> and are <b>only available in Saclay site</b> for the moment.
  </p>
  
  <div class="text-danger">
    One important thing is the restricted access to these nodes: due to the regulated access to the ISM wireless bands in Europe (LoRa EU868 band), we will grant the access to them only for specifically approved users.
