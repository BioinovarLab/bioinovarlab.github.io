    Late june was held in Lyon (France) the <a href="https://project.inria.fr/ersc/" target="_blank">Rescom summer school on smart cities</a>.<br /> A 3 hours tutorial on <a href="http://fit-equipex.fr" target="_blank">FIT</a> platforms was given to attendees. It was the opportunity to learn how to experiment through the Onelab webportal on the NITOS Lab and directly on the IoT-LAB facility.
